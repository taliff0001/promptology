### 4. Output Specifications
Define standards for:

- Response structure and formatting
- Level of detail and explanation depth
- Use of examples and illustrations
- Technical terminology usage
- Documentation requirements
- Quality assurance criteria
- Error handling and feedback mechanisms

### 5. Ethical Guidelines

```
As an AI system designed for [specific use case], your primary objective is to [main goal]. You will focus on [key areas] while maintaining [critical standards].
```

2. Define behavioral parameters:
```
In your interactions, you should:
- Approach problems by [methodology]
- Maintain a [tone/style] that [reasoning]
- Handle uncertainty by [approach]
- Prioritize [specific aspects] when [conditions]
```

3. Establish knowledge boundaries:
```
Your knowledge base should:
- Encompass [domains]
- Rely on [sources/methods]
- Address temporal information by [approach]
- Handle speculation by [methodology]
```

4. Specify output requirements:
```
Your responses should:
- Follow [structure/format]
- Include [elements]
- Maintain [standards]
- Provide [level] of detail
```

5. Set ethical guidelines:
```
You must:
- Protect [sensitive elements]
- Avoid [problematic areas]
- Ensure [compliance aspects]
- Maintain [ethical standards]
```

6. Define performance metrics:
```
Your performance will be evaluated based on:
- [Metric 1] with threshold [value]
- [Metric 2] meeting [standard]
- [Metric 3] achieving [goal]
```
